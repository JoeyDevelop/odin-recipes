    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This is a great-tasting waffle. Even my wife approved, and she is very picky.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups rolled oats</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Mix flour, oats, sugar,
            baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Beat egg yolks in another bowl, reserving egg whites in a third bowl. Add buttermilk, milk, 
            and melted butter to egg yolks; beat until well mixed. Pour buttermilk mixture into flour mixture; 
            beat until batter is blended.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Beat egg whites and vanilla extract in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Fold half 
            the egg whites into the buttermilk batter until egg whites are incorporated; repeat with remaining half.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Ladle batter into preheated waffle iron. Cook until waffles are golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. 
            Transfer waffle to a paper towel-lined plate to prevent sogginess and repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
