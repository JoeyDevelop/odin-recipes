    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>These cookie butter cookies are a flourless dessert made with Biscoff spread and using just 5
        ingredients! No flour, no dairy, and no butter needed, they take less than 10 minutes to bake!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup cookie butter</li>
            <li>½ cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Beat butter, brown sugar, and 3/4 cup white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until
                smooth. Add cookie butter and peanut butter; beat until fluffy. Mix flour, egg, baking soda,
                baking powder, and salt into butter mixture until dough comes together. Roll dough into teaspoon-size
                balls.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Spread 1/3 cup sugar into a shallow dish. Roll dough balls in sugar to coat and arrange onto the prepared
                baking sheet. Press the top of dough balls twice with a fork in a crosshatch shape.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
