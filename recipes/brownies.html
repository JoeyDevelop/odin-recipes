    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>They are rich, fudgy in the middle, and made completely from scratch. These brownies are so much better
         than the box, and I bet you have what you need to make them already sitting in your kitchen.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped walnuts</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a 3-quart saucepan over very low heat, melt butter and chocolate, stirring the mixture constantly.
                Remove from heat, and stir sugar into the chocolate. Allow the mixture to cool slightly. Beat in
                eggs one at a time, mixing well after each, then stir in vanilla. Combine flour and salt; stir
                into the chocolate mixture. Fold in walnuts. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, 30 to 35 minutes. Brownies are done when a toothpick inserted into
                the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack.</li>
         </ol>
