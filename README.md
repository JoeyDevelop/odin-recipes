# odin-recipes
Odin recipes project.

The Odin recipes project will be my first project following "The Odin Project"'s curriculum.
After this project I will have shown a thorough understanding of basic html. This includes
making the boilerplate, linking images and other pages within my website. I will also gain
a better understanding of the common git commands.
